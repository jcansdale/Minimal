# Minimal

Minimal is a Node.js personal website template. It doesn't have **any** external dependencies and runs with less than 500 lines of JavaScript. Everything is minimal, easy to take appart, rewrite or port.

## Getting Started

To get started, [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository) this repository, then modify `app.json` to your liking. The symbol codes for social links can be found [here](http://drinchev.github.io/monosocialiconsfont). For local development make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed. Run `./admin start` which will start `node app.js` and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser. `./admin` is a [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) script that can be run from Git Bash or [WLS](Windows Subsystem for Linux) on Windows.
