# Minimal

Minimal is a Node.js personal website template. It doesn't have **any** external dependencies and runs with less than 500 lines of JavaScript. Everything is minimal, easy to take appart, rewrite or port.

To get started, clone the repository and modify `app.json` to your liking. The symbol codes for social links can be found [here](http://drinchev.github.io/monosocialiconsfont/). When adding pages make sure the folder name ends with a `'/'` and add a corresponding subfolder with an `index.html` page.

If you haven't done so already, install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Next, to start the website on your local computer run `node app.js` and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
