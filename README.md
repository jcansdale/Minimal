# Minimal

Minimal is a Node.js personal website template. It doesn't have **any** external dependencies and runs with less than 500 lines of JavaScript. Everything is minimal, easy to take appart, rewrite or port.

To get started, [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository) this repository, then modify `app.json` to your liking. The symbol codes for social links can be found [here](http://drinchev.github.io/monosocialiconsfont).

To run the website on your local computer, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Start `node app.js` and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser. The `./admin client start` script will do both with a single command.
